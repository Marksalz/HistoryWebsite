        <p>
          Decades after the war, a small wooden trunk was found in the attic of
          the Whitmore family home. Inside were personal belongings of Private
          Thomas Whitmore — preserved memories of a life interrupted by war.

            The diary contains rough pencil sketches of the trenches, short
            notes, and dates. One entry reads: “January 3rd — rain again. Jam
            for dinner. Fritz still quiet.”
