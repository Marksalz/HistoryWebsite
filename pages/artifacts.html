        <p>
          Decades after the war, a small wooden trunk was found in the attic of
          the Whitmore family home. Inside were personal belongings of Private
          Thomas Whitmore — preserved memories of a life interrupted by war.

            The diary contains rough pencil sketches of the trenches, short
            notes, and dates. One entry reads: “January 3rd — rain again. Jam
            for dinner. Fritz still quiet.”

        <h3>Hidden Note</h3>
        <p>
          My dearest Sarah,<br /><br />
          The days grow long and the nights colder, but thoughts of home keep me
          warm. I hope this letter finds you and little James in good health.
          Tell Mother not to worry—my spirits remain high, and I am among
          friends.<br /><br />
          With all my love,<br />
          Thomas
