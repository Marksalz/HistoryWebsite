        <p>
          In the summer of 1914, Europe was plunged into a devastating conflict
          known as the First World War. More than 30 nations would become
          involved, and millions of lives were forever changed.

          <h3>Life in the Trenches</h3>
        </header>

        <p>
          Soldiers on the front lines lived in narrow trenches dug into the
          ground. The conditions were cold, muddy, and filled with danger.
          Letters from home were treasured, and writing back was a way to cope
          with the fear and loneliness.

          "It is cold and wet here. Mud up to the knees and not a soul to talk
          to but Tom and my rifle."<br />
          â€” Letter, January 1915

        <p>
          Most of the fighting occurred in Belgium and northern France. Armies
          built long trench lines across the countryside, and battles were
          fought for months over just a few kilometers of land.
