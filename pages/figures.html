        <p>
          Thomas Whitmore was a 19-year-old British soldier who enlisted in
          1915, full of patriotism and fear. He left behind his family farm in
          Yorkshire to fight in the Great War. Through his letters, we follow
          his personal thoughts, fears, and moments of hope during the darkest
          days of trench warfare.

        <blockquote>
          "We move at first light tomorrow. Some say this push will end it all,
          but I'm not so sure. I miss the smell of Mum's bread more than I
          thought possible."

        <p>
          Like many young men, Thomas dreamed of returning home and starting a
          family. He never made it back. He died during the Battle of the Somme
          in 1916, one of the deadliest battles of the war. His final letter was
          never sent, but it was found folded in his coat pocket.
