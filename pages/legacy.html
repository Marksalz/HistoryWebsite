          <h2>The Legacy of Thomas Whitmore</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Though Thomas Whitmore never returned home, his story lives on —
          through letters, family memories, and the generations who continue to
          honor those who served. His fictional experience reflects the real
          sacrifice of millions whose names may never be known.

            <h3>Remembrance Day</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            Every year on November 11th, people across the world observe a
            moment of silence for those lost in war. In the UK and Commonwealth,
            red poppies are worn to remember the fallen — a tradition that began
            after WWI.

            <h3>Letters That Taught Us</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            War letters are now studied in classrooms, museums, and libraries.
            They teach us about fear, friendship, and the human spirit during
            times of chaos. Through fictional letters like Thomas’s, we preserve
            that voice.

            <h3>Why We Remember</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            Remembering those who served is not about glorifying war — it is
            about understanding its cost. The stories of soldiers like Thomas
            help remind us of our shared humanity, and our responsibility to
            build peace.
